**Strathmore Agri-Food Innovation Center ** is conducting a survey to understand ** the dynamics of livestock /feeds farming and outgrowing in order  ** to correctly advise on policy and research.

**Why should you be involved?**  
*We selected your household since you are a livestock/feeds farmer/outgrower from Kajiado, Samburu and Narok counties whom we have interacted with before in our baseline/midline surveys. The survey will take about 30 minutes*    

**What will the data you provide be used for?** 
 The data you provide is for research purposes only, **will be confidential and will not be used outside of this study.** All reporting will be at an aggregate level and no household will be singled out.      

In case you have questions or comments about this survey, please do not hesitate to contact:
