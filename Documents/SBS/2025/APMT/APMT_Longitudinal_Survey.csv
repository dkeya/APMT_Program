**Strathmore Agri-Food Innovation Center ** is conducting a survey to understand ** the dynamics of livestock /feeds farming and outgrowing in order  ** to correctly advise on policy and research.

**Why should you be involved?**  
*We selected your household since you are a livestock/feeds farmer/outgrower from Kajiado, Samburu and Narok counties whom we have interacted with before in our baseline/midline surveys. The survey will take about 30 minutes*    

**What will the data you provide be used for?** 
 The data you provide is for research purposes only, **will be confidential and will not be used outside of this study.** All reporting will be at an aggregate level and no household will be singled out.
